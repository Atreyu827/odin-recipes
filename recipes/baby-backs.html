        <h2>Baby Back Ribs</h2>
        <p>These are to-die-for ribs you will want to serve to guests, to show off your cooking ability.</p>
        <p>Baby back ribs are tender, and the meat falls right off the bone. Generally, people think of baby back ribs
            as a
            meal they would only order at a restaurant, but they are so easy to make at home.
            This recipe could not be more simple.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 pounds baby back pork ribs</li>
            <li>Â½ gallon apple juice</li>
            <li>1 head garlic, separated into cloves</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon granulated garlic</li>
            <li>2 cups barbeque sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare charcoal in a smoker, and bring the temperature to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Cut the ribs into smaller portions of 3 or 4 ribs, and place them in a large pot. Pour in enough apple
                juice
                to cover. Place a lid on the pot and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat, and let stand for 15
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Lightly oil the grate in your smoker. Place ribs on the grate, and throw a few cloves of garlic onto the
                hot
                coals. Close the smoker. Maintain the temperature at 225 degrees F (110 degrees C) by adding more
                charcoal
                as needed. Smoke the ribs for 7 hours, adding more garlic cloves to the coals occasionally.</li>
            <li>Make a sauce by mixing together the barbeque sauce with 2 cups of the apple juice from the pot. Season
                with
                granulated garlic. Baste ribs with this sauce while continuing to cook for another 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
